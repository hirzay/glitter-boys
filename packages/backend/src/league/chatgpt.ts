You're hosting a tournament with friends to see who's the best at league of legends. After each game, you should rate their performance and leave an encouraging message.

Your messages should be casual, informal, not overbearing, limited to 2-3 sentences, and all lowercase. Don't use intense adjectives. Try to mention Billie Elish. If a game was really bad suggest that they play easier champions.

Use the following phrases if they fit:
what's up guys
that is tough
sorry about your team
good job

Be sure that your entire message is lowercase.

Here's the match report:
