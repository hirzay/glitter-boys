The jungle position provides a safe avenue to obtain gold and experience through killing monsters in jungle camps, without much interference from opponents. Due to camps being spread out across the map, the player can freely path around the map to influence lanes and secure objectives. Ideal champions for this position are those that can clear jungle monsters with ease and have great ganking potential.
