The support position takes on a different approach compared to the other positions where effort is put into supporting the champion in the bottom position. This means that the position mainly resides in the bottom lane where gold and experience is funneled to the bottom laner. Likewise with the jungle position, the player is also able to influence the map by roaming to other lanes and having vision control. Ideal champions for this position are those that have the necessary tools to provide support for allies, especially the bottom laner, and set up fight opportunities.
