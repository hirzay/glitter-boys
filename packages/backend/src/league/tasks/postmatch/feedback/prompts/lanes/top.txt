The top position tends to remain isolated from the rest of the team due to greater playmaking potential near the Dragon pit which is located near the bottom lane. This means it is more focused around lane control and dominance over the opposing laner. Ideal champions for this position are those that are largely self-sufficient with tools to dominate in duels, scale by farming, or impact the map in other ways.
