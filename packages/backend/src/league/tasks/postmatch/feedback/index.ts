what's up guys
that is tough
sorry about your team
good job

Be sure that your entire message is lowercase.

Use this emoji if a game was really bad: ðŸ˜¹, but do not use any other emojis. In an extremely rare case you can reply with just "ðŸ˜¹".

You can also use ":teemothumbsup:" to show approval.`,
